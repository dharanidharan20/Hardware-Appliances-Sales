The Sales.sql file is analysing the sale of the Hardware with different tables like Customers,Products,Orders,Ordersdetails.

# Sales Database
This project contains a **Sales Database** built using **MySQL**. It is designed to store and analyze customer and sales-related information, which can be further used for reporting and dashboard creation (e.g., in Power BI or Tableau).

## Features
* **Customers Table**: Stores customer details like name, age, gender, city, state, and phone.
* **Sales Data** (extendable): Can be linked with products, orders, and transactions for full analysis.
* **Preloaded Data**: Includes sample entries for quick testing and learning.

## Project Structure
* `Sales.sql` â†’ MySQL script to create database and insert sample data.
* Tables included:
  * **Customers** (basic customer details)
  * *(extendable with Products, Orders, Transactions if required)*
